# Arduino Simulation LCD

This repository contains an Arduino simulation for interfacing with a liquid crystal display (LCD) in a virtual environment. The Arduino Simulation LCD provides a platform for testing and debugging Arduino code that interacts with LCD displays without the need for physical hardware. This simulation allows developers to simulate various LCD configurations and visualize the output of their Arduino projects in real-time.

## Description

Liquid crystal displays (LCDs) are commonly used in Arduino projects to provide visual feedback and display information to users. However, testing Arduino code that interacts with LCDs can be challenging without access to physical hardware. The Arduino Simulation LCD offers a solution by simulating the behavior of an LCD display within the Arduino development environment.

The simulation provides an emulated LCD screen that mimics the functionality of physical LCD displays, including features such as text display, cursor control, and custom character generation. Developers can write and upload Arduino code that interacts with the simulated LCD, allowing them to test their code, visualize output, and debug potential issues before deploying it to physical hardware.

## Features

### 1. Emulated LCD Display

The simulation provides an emulated LCD screen that replicates the behavior of physical LCD displays commonly used in Arduino projects. Developers can interact with the emulated display using familiar Arduino commands and functions, allowing for seamless integration with existing Arduino code.

### 2. Real-time Visualization

The simulation allows developers to visualize the output of their Arduino code in real-time on the emulated LCD display. This feature enables developers to monitor the behavior of their code, identify potential issues, and make adjustments as needed without the need for physical hardware.

### 3. Configurable Parameters

The simulation allows developers to configure various parameters of the emulated LCD display, including screen size, character set, cursor behavior, and backlight brightness. This flexibility enables developers to simulate different LCD configurations and test their Arduino code under various conditions.

## Usage
